This repository contains several examples of lambda expressions and the Stream API.  You can see them in ```src/EmployeeManager.java```

There is also a presentation that covers similar topics.  It is designed to take about 1 hour with questions.

And finally, in ```interactive-workshop``` is a modified version of the presentation to be in a format that allows for audience participation.  The participants should load the code into their IDE and implement the methods using material taught in the presentation.  This takes 1.5 to 2 hours.
