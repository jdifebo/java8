This repository contains several examples of lambda expressions and the Stream API

It has been modified to go along with a powerpoint presentation, also included.

The goal is to implement each of the methods in EmployeeManager using Java 8 features.  Each one can be implemented
in a single line, typically be returning a single expression.  Also, commented out non-java-8 implementations are
provided; some of those implementations are quite verbose!
