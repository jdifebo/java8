This repository contains several examples of lambda expressions and the Stream API.  You can see them in [```src/EmployeeManager.java```](https://github.com/jdifebo/java8/blob/master/src/EmployeeManager.java)

There is also a presentation that covers similar topics.  It is designed to take about 1 hour with questions.  View it in your browser [here](http://jdifebo.github.io/java8/presentation/presentation.pdf)

And finally, in ```interactive-workshop``` is a modified version of the presentation to be in a format that allows for audience participation.  The participants should load the code into their IDE and implement the methods using material taught in the presentation.  This takes 1.5 to 2 hours.
