This is a modified form of the presentation that allows the audience to write solutions to problems as the presentation goes on.  If you look inside of ```EmployeeManager.java```, the code compiles but is incomplete and does not pass the provided unit tests.  As the presentation progresses, participants should be able to implement all of the methods correctly using lambda expressions.  This interactive workshop will take approximately 1.5 to 2 hours.
